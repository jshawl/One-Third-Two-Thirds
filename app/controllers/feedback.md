## Project Workflow

**Does Not Meet Expectations**

Please remove the README.rdoc and create a README.md that explains your project,
including any necessary setup instructions. This will be very useful for future you
and technical employers who are not familiar with Rails.

## Technical Requirements

**Meets Expectations**

Excellent job implementing the 3 models with associations and user authentication! When you
revisit this project, I recommend restricting delete / edit functionality to the users who 
created that post. 

## Creativity / Interface

**Meets Expectations**

Nice job on your CSS and the show/hide functionality for subtasks. re: the comment above about 
restricting functionality - you can only display certain links based on the type of user. e.g. don't
show a link to "create new project" unless the user is logged in.

## Deployment and Functionality

**Does Not Meet Expectations**

Please include the deployed URL in your Repo's description. I was able to log in and create a project
successfully, but get an error when trying to create a subtask. Happy to pair with you on
this functionality if you like. Otherwise, I recommend hiding the feature until it is operable.
